Do NOT thank me for creating these pipemenus for compiz-boxmenu. 
These are just ported from some openbox pipemenus. 
If you know the authors, please thank them, they're the real makers of these.
I just ported them.

Most of these have a _icon and normal named variant. For those ones, use the <command>_icon version to get icons for these pipeitems.
The ones you don't thank me for making (just for porting):
cpzbookmarks (don't know author)
cpzbookmarks_icons (don't know author)
cpztrash (don't know author)
cpztrash_icons (don't know author)
cpzcalendar.sh (don't know author, appeared at http://openbox.org/wiki/Openbox:Pipemenus:Date_Menu)
cpzcalendar_icons.sh (don't know author, appeared at http://openbox.org/wiki/Openbox:Pipemenus:Date_Menu)
cpzplaces.sh (don't know author, appeared at http://david.chalkskeletons.com/scripts/bookmarks.sh)
cpzplaces_icons.sh (don't know author, appeared at http://david.chalkskeletons.com/scripts/bookmarks.sh)
cpzbrowse (By Dirk Sohler)
cpzfilebrowser (Copyright (C) 2009,2010 Xyne | check out the official implementation at http://xyne.archlinux.ca/projects/obfilebrowser/)
And much more that I need to update this...

Here are the ones you can thank me for:
cpzaudacious (manages Audacious in a simple menu)
manage_menus.sh (pulls up a list of menu files in your $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/compiz/boxmenu folder and displays them for editing)

How to use (the ones I made):
cpzaudacious -i (if you want icons) <icon of choice for audacious, by name only for now>
manage_menus.sh -i (if you want icons) <icon of choice for menu, by name only for now> <icon of choice for items, by name only for now>
